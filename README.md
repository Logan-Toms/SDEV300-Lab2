## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To create a secure password based on user input.
- To calculate and format a percentage.
- To calculate the number of days from today until a specific future date.
- To use the Law of Cosines to calculate the leg of a triangle.
- To calculate the volume of a Right Circular Cylinder.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring user inputs are valid and within specified constraints.
- **Mathematical Calculations**: Performing various mathematical operations and formulas.
- **User Interaction**: Creating user-friendly command-line interfaces for interaction.
